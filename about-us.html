								<h2>Our history</h2>
								<p>Broker Man Australia was established in 2001 to provide personal & professional broking services to those that require dedicated access to a wide range of general insurance products across both domestic and international markets. We've always operated with the belief that an unparalleled, one-to-one service is the key to high quality broking, and since day one our personal, friendly and efficient process has helped us to grow. </p>
								<h2>Our ways of working</h2>
									<p>Our fundamental objective has always been to give our clients a consistently high level of service to add value to their businesses. We achieve this by:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Becoming familiar with your business so we can work together to assess your unique insurance requirements</li>
								<li>Carrying out reviews of policies available so we can select those that suit the your needs and create a tailored package</li>
								<li>Providing advice for contractual insurance obligations where hold harmless and special requirements are needed</li>
								<li>Monitoring the insurance market to take advantage of changes that may benefit you</li>
								<li>Working with you on all claims issues</li>
								<li>Being accessible at all levels within our organisation</li>
							</ul>
							<p>With over 35 years of experience within the local insurance industry, the management at Broker Man Australia is committed to excellence, offering a wide range of services that are personally delivered and professional conducted. Consistently high levels of client satisfaction are testimony to our dedication to achieving our service goals.</p>
